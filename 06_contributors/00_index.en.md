# BSAM main contributors.

BSAM has been made possible thanks to the work of [Tarlogic Security's](https://www.tarlogic.com/) cybersecurity innovation unit. This team's goal is to research and promote hardware security, IoT technologies, wireless communication protocols (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.), and emerging technologies.

For example, they are responsible for developing the [Acrylic Wi-Fi](https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/) product range, conducting research on security issues in smart meters with PRIME technology, and discovering Bluetooth vulnerabilities such as Bluetrust.
