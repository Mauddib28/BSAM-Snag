# {{ page.summary }}

Vulnerability enumeration can generally be done by searching vulnerability databases or general purpose search engines such as Google.

## Vulnerability databases
Some of the most common vulnerability databases are listed below:

| Name          | URL                           |
|:--------------|:------------------------------|
| Exploit DB    | <https://www.exploit-db.com/> |
| VulnDB        | <https://vuldb.com/>          |
| NIST NVD      | <https://nvd.nist.gov/>       |
| MITRE CVE     | <https://cve.mitre.org/>      |

It is important to conduct multiple searches with different keywords and to complement these searches in specialized databases with searches in more generic engines.
