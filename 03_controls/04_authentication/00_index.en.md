![Bluetooth Authentication - BSAM]({{ '/assets/img/bluetooth-bsam-authentication.jpg' | relative_url}})
This group of controls (**BSAM-AU**) focuses on the security of the **authentication** process of Bluetooth devices.

The objective of this group is the evaluation of the configuration of the analyzed device, making sure that it does not allow the authentication of unknown devices, avoiding exfiltrating information that should not be known without a legitimate authentication process.
