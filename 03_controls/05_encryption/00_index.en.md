![Bluetooth Encryption - BSAM]({{ '/assets/img/bluetooth-bsam-encryption.jpg' | relative_url}})
This group of controls (**BSAM-EN**) focuses on the security of the **encryption** process of Bluetooth communications.

The objective of this group is the evaluation of the configuration of the analyzed device, making sure that it does not allow the transmission of sensitive data in the clear or the downgrade of the encryption mechanisms, avoiding the exfiltration of information that should not be public.
