![Bluetooth Services - BSAM]({{ '/assets/img/bluetooth-bsam-services.jpg' | relative_url}})
This group of controls (**BSAM-SE**)  focuses on the **security of available Bluetooth services** in a device.

The objective of this group is the evaluation of the configuration of the analysed device, making sure that it does not allow the access to services without proper authorization to avoid exfiltrating information that should not be known without a proper access clearance.
