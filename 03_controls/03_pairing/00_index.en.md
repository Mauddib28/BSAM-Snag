![Bluetooth Pairing - BSAM]({{ '/assets/img/bluetooth-bsam-pairing.jpg' | relative_url}})
This section (**BSAM-PA**) deals with possible configuration and operation issues of the **pairing** process.

The objective of this group is the evaluation of the configuration of the analyzed device as well as the study of the supported pairing modes, making sure that no sensitive data or vulnerable configurations are exposed, and that no pairing of devices is allowed without user notification and supervision.
