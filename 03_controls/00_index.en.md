Within BSAM, controls are the technical checks that must be carried out to assess, from a security standpoint, a device with Bluetooth capabilities.

Excluding the initial information gathering section, the **security controls** have been grouped into 6 blocks according to the standard operation of the Bluetooth protocol.

All controls are categorized according to whether they affect **Bluetooth Classic** (BR/EDR) or **Bluetooth LE** (BLE).
