![Bluetooth discovery - BSAM]({{ '/assets/img/bluetooth-bsam-discovery.jpg' | relative_url}})
This group of controls (**BSAM-DI**) focuses on the security of the **Bluetooth discovery process**.

The goal is the evaluation of the configuration of the analyzed device as well as the study of the data it publicly transmits in the discovery phase, verifying that sensitive data or vulnerable configurations are not exposed.

The following tests aim to analyze security in **Bluetooth discovery mode**
