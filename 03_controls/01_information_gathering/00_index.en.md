![Bluetooth Information gathering- BSAM]({{ '/assets/img/bluetooth-bsam-Information-gathering.jpg' | relative_url}})
Bluetooth component **information gathering** controls (**BSAM-IG**) focus on gathering public information about the device and its various components. 

The goal of these controls is to obtain valuable security-related information, such as the enumeration of known vulnerabilities. This information can help to accelerate the device's security analysis and technical testing using public information.

These controls are aligned with [NIST 8228 Considerations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8228/final)
